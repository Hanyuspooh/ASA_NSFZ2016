Welcome to the ASA_NSFZ2016 wiki! I am just trying to use this. So these are the things we need to do,

Find a topic
Do the research of data needed
Find a way to analyse and to solve the research question
Further analyse the results and come to a conclusion, taking into account of information or previous work available
It was not easy for me to use the datasets. In fact, in most of the websites provided I didn't find datasets. The uci one is relatively easy to use. I downloaded some datasets which are in a sense business related. I have these relatively new topics, which might be fruitful for drawing an insight upon.

Bike sharing data: the times a bike is used, the % of repair etc, in order to discuss why this industry was prosperous and declining so quickly after its peak;
eco-hotel data (linguistic, 99% are saying it was a good experience, in order to lead to a discussion on new ways of living a life), the research question can be, how is eco-hotel serving the environment?
In both cases the current dataset will not be enough to complete the solution of the question. In order to answer a question, I propose a proper modeling be built, so that all independent variable can be taken into account. Some of them may needing numbers and analysis from databases. Some of them can come from surveys conducted. I don't know whether there will be qualitative analysis involved too.

The above is my understanding of the work at first step. Given that I had no previous experience on this, I am writing this so that you still have time to correct me in case I was bullshitting for all this long.:)

Oh this Wiki is actually beautifully composed.
